[x] Add ram in the tab list
[] Make sure ram usage is accurate (or at least mostly accurate)
[] Add teams and sorting
[] Add custom animations (like automatic rainbow instead of making 1 long line in the config)
[] Add different placeholders from different mods, not just essentials and placeholder api (PAPI)
[] Make it less cpu heavy (it already is way less cpu + ram heavy unlike a certain tab plugin (totally not https://modrinth.com/plugin/tab-was-taken))
[] Make sure global player list works (enable/disable from config)
[] Make a per-world list (make sure it can be enabled/disabled so its not in conflict with a global list)
[] Make a wiki instead of having it in the config, will likely be @ https://wiki.icicle1133.cc/ricetabbylist (NOT A VALID LINK YET)
