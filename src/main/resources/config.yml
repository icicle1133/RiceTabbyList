# Rice's Tabby List Configuration
# ANYTHING THAT SAYS DO NOT TOUCH YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLORS OF
# BLANK LINES ("") ARE JUST EMPTY LINES TO SPACE STUFF OUT

#   {ram_free} - Free RAM in MB
#   {ram_percent} - RAM usage percentage
#   {ram_usage} - Formatted RAM (e.g., "2048/4096 MB")
#   {ram_usage_percent} - Formatted RAM with % (e.g., "2048/4096 MB (50%)")
#
# =====================================================

# Server domain/IP (change this or everyone will know you're lazy)
domain: "play.yourserver.com"

# Tab list configuration (the whole point)
tab:
  # Update interval in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)
  update-interval: 20
  
  header:
    - "&x&F&F&0&0&F&F&lYOUR SERVER" # change this
    - "&7{domain}"
    - ""
    - "&eTPS: &f{tps} &7| &eOnline: &f{players}/{max_players}"
    - "&eStaff Online: &f{op_count}"
    - "&eRAM: &f{ram_usage}"
    - ""
  
  # Footer (bottom of tab list) - Multiple lines supported
  footer:
    - ""
    - "&7Thanks for playing!" # you can change this
    - "&eWebsite: &f{domain}"
  
  # Player name format in tab list

  player-format: "{afk_status}&7{player}"

# That's it. Simple, right? No bloated configs here.
