# =====================================================
# Rice's Tabby List Configuration
# ANYTHING THAT SAYS DO NOT TOUCH YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLORS OF
# BLANK LINES ("") ARE JUST EMPTY LINES TO SPACE STUFF OUT
# =====================================================
# Color codes: Use & for colors (e.g., &a = green, &c = red)
# 
# Internal Placeholders (use with {} brackets):
#   {tps} - Current server TPS
#   {op_count} - Number of online OP players
#   {players} - Current online players
#   {max_players} - Maximum player slots
#   {domain} - Server domain/IP
#   {player} - Player's name
#   {afk} - Player AFK status (true/false)
#   {afk_status} - Formatted AFK tag
#
# =====================================================

# Server domain/IP (change this or everyone will know you're lazy)
domain: "play.yourserver.com"

# Tab list configuration (the whole point)
tab:
  # Update interval in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)
  update-interval: 20
  
  header:
    - "&7YOUR SERVER" # change this
    - "&7{domain}"
    - ""
    - "&eTPS: &f{tps} &7| &eOnline: &f{players}/{max_players}"
    - "&eStaff Online: &f{op_count}"
    - ""
  
  # Footer (bottom of tab list) - Multiple lines supported
  footer:
    - ""
    - "&7Thanks for playing!" # you can change this
    - "&eWebsite: &f{domain}"
  
  # Player name format in tab list
  # {player} will be replaced with the player's name
  player-format: "{afk_status}&7{player}"

# That's it. Simple, right? No bloated configs here.
